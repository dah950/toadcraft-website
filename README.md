# ToadCraft Website
This is the official website for all the ToadCraft Minecraft servers. This website isn't quite finished yet, but it is good enough for now.\
ToadCraft is a group of Minecraft servers that are run by the Heath family. We also make modpacks for them [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/daxtonheath).\
You can find out about the Minecraft servers [here](https://www.toadhead.net). (or you can be a nerd and look through the source code yourself)\
This page is still a work in progress, so please be patient if something behaves unexpectedly.
